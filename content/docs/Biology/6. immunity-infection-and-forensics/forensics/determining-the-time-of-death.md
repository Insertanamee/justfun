Determining the Time of Death
-----------------------------

* <b>Forensics</b> is the use of science in the <b>investigation of criminal activities</b>

  + It involves the <b>collection and analysis of evidence</b> from a potential crime scene e.g. the scene at which a dead body is found
* Determining the <b>time of death</b> (TOD) of a body is a very important component of <b>forensic science</b>

  + The TOD can be used during a police investigation to provide information about the <b>circumstances surrounding the death </b>of a person
* In order to accurately estimate TOD, there are <b>several factors</b> that must be established

  + Extent of decomposition
  + Stage of succession
  + Forensic entomology
  + Body temperature of the deceased
  + The degree of muscle contraction

#### Extent of decomposition

* The process of decomposition begins soon after death

  + Decomposition is carried out by organisms known as<b> decomposers</b> e.g. bacteria and fungi

    - Enzymes secreted from the cells of these organisms break down biological molecules in dead tissue
* The time since death can often be established visually by looking at the appearance of a body that is decomposing

  + Decomposers break down <b>cells and tissues </b>over the course of a few days

    - At this stage in decomposition the appearance of the skin can be a helpful indication of time since death; <b>skin will often appear greenish in colour</b>
  + The next stage of decomposition involves the <b>breakdown of tissues and organs</b> by micro-organisms over the course of a few days or weeks

    - This process produces gases, such as methane, which will lead to <b>bloating</b>
    - The <b>skin will blister and fall off</b> the rest of the body
  + A few <b>weeks after death </b>the remains of the soft tissues will <b>turn to liquid</b> which becomes visible as it <b>leaves the body</b>
  + This process will continue over the course of <b>months or years </b>until only a <b>skeleton</b> remain
  + After a <b>few decades or centuries,</b> the skeleton will <b>disintegrate</b> until nothing remains
* The rate of decomposition will be affected by factors such as <b>temperature </b>and <b>availability of oxygen</b>

  + Decomposition would be slower in anaerobic conditions and at lower temperatures but would be faster at high temperatures

#### Stage of succession

* Succession refers to the <b>change in the types of organisms</b> found in a habitat over time

  + This is often an ecology term that is applied to a habitat such as a pond or woodland, but in this case the <b>habitat is the dead body</b>

    - The difference between succession in ecology and in forensics is that in an ecosystem the early pioneer species are out-competed and disappear as the system matures, while in a dead body <b>all of the newly arriving species remain as decomposition progresses</b>
* The <b>stage of succession</b> of a body can provide information about the estimated TOD
* <b>Above ground </b>the body would undergo the following stages of succession

  + <b>Bacteria</b> will be found in and on the dead body immediately after TOD
  + As tissue decomposition sets in it creates ideal conditions for <b>flies</b> to lay eggs and their <b>larvae</b> to hatch
  + As more soft tissue is consumed by the fly larvae it creates favourable conditions for <b>beetles</b> to establish
  + When <b>tissue dries out</b> over time <b>flies will leave</b> the body as they prefer a moisture-rich environment
  + <b>Beetles</b>, however, can decompose dry tissue so they <b>will remain </b>on the body
  + Once all tissues have been decomposed most organisms will leave the body
* These <b>succession stages will differ</b> depending on where the body is located as the <b>accessibility to insects</b> and <b>availability of oxygen</b> will be affected e.g.

  + Buried in soil
  + Buried in a coffin
  + Under water

#### Forensic entomology

* A dead body provides an ideal habitat for many <b>species of insects;</b> the study of these insect colonies is known as <b>forensic entomology</b>
* <b>Different insect species </b>will colonise a body at different times after death, providing information about the TOD

  + Flies will be found on the body within a few hours after death, while beetles will only colonise the body later

* Another clue that insects can provide is the <b>stage of life cycle </b>they are at

  + E.g. blowfly eggs will hatch after about 24 hours so if larvae are present on the body it indicates that the person died more than 24 hours ago

    - Other insects have longer life cycles, so if <b>only</b> blowfly larvae are found it indicates that <b>only</b> 24 hours has passed since TOD
  + Factors that might affect the<b> progression of insect life cycles </b>include

    - Drugs that may be present in the body
    - Humidity of the surroundings
    - Oxygen availability
    - Temperature

#### Body temperature

* Respiration and other metabolic processes <b>produce heat </b>in living organisms

  + This heat is necessary for maintaining our body temperature at around <b>37 °C</b> during life
* Once a person dies <b>metabolic reactions</b> will eventually <b>come to an end</b>

  + Since no more heat is produced the <b>body temperature</b> <b>drops</b> until it reaches the temperature of the surrounding environment
  + This process of cooling is known as <i><b>algor mortis</b></i>
* Body temperature decreases by <b>1.5</b>-<b>2.0 °C</b> <b>per hour</b>, therefore providing forensic scientists with a way to determine the TOD based on the temperature of the body
* Certain conditions will affect the rate at which body heat is lost e.g.

  + Air temperature
  + Surface area : volume ratio
  + Presence of clothing

#### Degree of muscle contraction

* <b>Muscles</b> in the body begin to <b>contract</b> about 4-6 hours after TOD, leading to a general stiffening of the body known as <i><b>rigor mortis</b></i>
* <i>Rigor mortis</i> comes about as a result of changes to the proteins in muscle cells after death

  + Since <b>no more oxygen</b> reaches the muscle cells after death they will start to <b>respire anaerobically, </b>producing <b>lactic acid </b>
  + The accumulation of lactic acid <b>decreases the pH</b> in the muscle cells, <b>denaturing the enzymes</b> that produce ATP
  + Without ATP the myosin heads <b>cannot be released</b> from the actin filaments, <b>locking the muscles in a contracted state</b>

    - Muscles contract due to the action of two protein filaments; myosin and actin
    - The binding of myosin heads to actin proteins followed by the bending of the myosin heads causes muscle contraction
    - ATP is required to allow the myosin heads to detach from the binding sites on actin
  + This leads to the stiffness that is the main characteristic of <i>rigor mortis</i>
* <i>Rigor mortis</i> will begin in the smaller muscles of the head and end in the larger muscles of the lower body, meaning that forensic experts can determine TOD by the progress of <i>rigor mortis</i><i><b> </b></i>through the body

  + <i>Rigor mortis</i> would have taken place in every muscle between 12 and 18 hours after death, but will wear off again after about 24 to 36 hours from TOD
* The process is affected by the <b>level of muscle development</b> and the <b>temperature of the surroundings</b>

  + Higher temperatures will speed up the rate of <i>rigor mortis</i>

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

Remember that the time of death is only an estimate, it cannot be pinpointed exactly. There are so many factors that will affect a dead body that it is nearly impossible to provide a time of death that will be precisely accurate. Keep this in mind when answering questions on this topic.
