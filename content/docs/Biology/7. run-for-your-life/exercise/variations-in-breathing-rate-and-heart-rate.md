Variations in Breathing Rate & Heart Rate
-----------------------------------------

* During exercise, <b>muscle contraction</b> occurs <b>more frequently</b>, requiring <b>more energy</b>
* The <b>rate of </b><b>aerobic respiration</b><b> increases</b> to meet the increase in energy demand
* This means that cells <b>require more oxygen</b> to be delivered to them, while <b>producing more carbon dioxide</b> as a waste product of respiration
* The body will accommodate this by making the following changes:

  + <b>Increase the rate and depth of breathing </b>which will increase the amount of oxygen entering the lungs and bloodstream, while getting rid of more carbon dioxide
  + <b>Increase the heart rate</b> which will transport the oxygen (and glucose) to the muscles much faster, while removing the additional carbon dioxide produced due to the increased rate of respiration

#### Control of the breathing rate

* Breathing rate is controlled by the <b>ventilation centres</b> (also called respiratory centres) in the <b>medulla oblongata</b>

  + This is one of the three regions that make up the brainstem, it transfers nerve messages from the brain to the spinal cord
  + The <b>inspiratory centre</b> controls the movement of air into the lungs (inhalation)
  + The <b>expiratory centre</b> controls the movement of air out of the lungs (exhalation)
* The <b>inspiratory centre</b> in the medulla oblongata has the following effect on breathing:

  + It sends <b>nerve impulses</b> along motor neurons to the <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> of the ribs and <b>diaphragm muscles</b>
  + These muscles will <b>contract</b> and cause the <b>volume of the chest to increase</b>
  + This <b>lowers the air pressure in the lungs</b> to slightly below atmospheric pressure
  + An <b>impulse</b> is also sent to the <b>expiratory centre</b> to <b>inhibit</b> its action
  + Due to the difference in pressure between the lungs and outside air, <b>air will flow into</b> the lungs
* <b>Stretch receptors</b> in the lungs are stimulated as they inflate with air
* Nerve impulses are sent back to the medulla oblongata which will <b>inhibit the inspiratory centre</b>
* The <b>expiratory centre </b>is no longer inhibited and will bring about the following changes:

  + It sends <b>nerve impulses</b> to the <b>intercostal </b>and <b>diaphragm muscles</b>
  + These muscles will <b>relax</b> and cause the <b>volume of the chest to decrease</b>
  + This <b>increases the air pressure</b> in the lungs to slightly above atmospheric pressure
  + Due to the higher pressure in the lungs, <b>air will flow out</b> of the lungs
* As the lungs <b>deflate</b>, the <b>stretch receptors become inactive</b> which means that the inspiratory centre is <b>no longer inhibited</b> and the next breathing cycle can begin

#### Effect of exercise

* The <b>extra carbon dioxide</b> that is produced <b>due to the increase in the rate of respiration</b> during exercise dissolves in the blood to form <b>carbonic acid</b>
* This quickly <b>dissociates into hydrogen ions </b>(H<sup>+</sup>) and hydrogencarbonate ions (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>)
* The increase in the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions will <b>decrease the pH of the blood</b> (it becomes more acidic)
* The decrease in pH is <b>detected by receptors</b> sensitive to changes in the chemical composition of blood
* These are called <b>chemoreceptors</b> and they are located in several places

  + In the ventilation centre of the <b>medulla oblongata</b>
  + They are also present as clusters of cells in the aorta (<b>aortic bodies</b>) and the carotid arteries (<b>carotid bodies</b>)
* Once they are stimulated a <b>nerve impulse</b> is sent to the <b>medulla oblongata</b>
* The medulla oblongata will then send <b>more frequent nerve impulses</b> to the intercostal and diaphragm muscles to increase the rate and strength of contractions
* This <b>increases</b> the breathing rate and depth
* This results in <b>more oxygen</b> entering the lungs (and bloodstream), while <b>more carbon dioxide</b> can be exhaled and thus be removed from the bloodstream
* The <b>decrease in carbon dioxide</b> levels will result in the <b>blood pH returning back to normal</b>, which leads to the breathing rate returning to normal
* The volume of air that moves in and out of the lungs during a set time period (e.g. a minute) is known as the <b>ventilation rate</b>
* The ventilation rate <b>increases during exercise</b> due to the increase in breathing rate and depth

#### Control of the heart rate

* The <b>cardiovascular control centre</b> in the <b>medulla oblongata</b> unconsciously <b>controls the heart rate</b> by controlling the rate at which the <b>sinoatrial node </b>(<b>SAN</b>) generates electrical impulses
* These electrical impulses cause the atria to contract and therefore <b>determines the rhythm of a heartbeat</b>
* Changes in the internal environment of the body (e.g. blood pressure, oxygen levels) can result in a change in the heart rate
* These changes act as <b>stimuli</b> which is detected by <b>baroreceptors</b> and <b>chemoreceptors</b>

  + <b>Baroreceptors</b> are found in the <b>aortic </b>and <b>carotid bodies</b> and they are stimulated by <b>high and low blood pressure</b>
  + <b>Chemoreceptors</b> are found in the <b>medulla oblongata</b>, as well as in the <b>aortic</b> and <b>carotid bodies</b>
  + They are stimulated by changes in the <b>levels of carbon dioxide</b> and <b>oxygen</b> in the blood, as well as <b>blood pH</b>
* Once stimulated, these receptors will <b>send electrical impulses</b> to the medulla oblongata
* The cardiovascular control centre in the medulla oblongata will respond by sending impulses to the SAN along <b>sympathetic</b> or <b>parasympathetic neurones</b>
* Each of these neurones release different <b>neurotransmitters</b> which will affect the SAN in a different way

  + <b>Sympathetic neurones </b>will increase the rate at which the SAN generates electrical impulses, thus <b>speeding up</b> the heart rate

    - These neurones form part of the <b>sympathetic nervous system</b> which prepares the body for <b>action</b> ('fight or flight' response) and <b>increases the heart rate</b> during exercise
  + <b>Parasympathetic neurones</b> will decrease the rate at which the SAN fires, thus <b>slowing down</b> the heart rate

    - These neurones form part of the <b>parasympathetic nervous system</b> which <b>calms</b> the body down after action ('rest and digest' response) and <b>decreases the heart rate</b> after exercise

#### Changes in heart rate

* The heart will respond in different way depending on the stimulus that it receives
* <b>High blood pressure</b>

  + Detected by <b>baroreceptors</b> which send impulses to <b>cardiovascular control centre</b>
  + It sends impulses along <b>parasympathetic</b> neurones which secrete the neurotransmitter <b>acetylcholine</b>
  + Acetylcholine binds to receptors on <b>SAN</b> causing it to fire <b>less frequently</b>
  + Heart rate <b>slows down</b> and blood pressure decreases back to normal
* <b>Low blood pressure</b>

  + Detected by <b>baroreceptors</b> which send impulses to <b>cardiovascular control centre</b>
  + It sends impulses along <b>sympathetic</b> neurones which secrete the neurotransmitter <b>noradrenaline</b>
  + Noradrenaline binds to receptors on <b>SAN</b> causing it to fire <b>more frequently</b>
  + Heart rate <b>speeds up</b> and blood pressure increases back to normal
* <b>High blood O</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> / Low CO</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> / high pH levels</b>

  + Detected by <b>chemoreceptors</b> which send impulses to <b>cardiovascular control centre</b>
  + It sends impulses along <b>parasympathetic</b> neurones which secrete the neurotransmitter <b>acetylcholine</b>
  + Acetylcholine binds to receptors on <b>SAN</b> causing it to fire <b>less frequently</b>
  + Heart rate <b>slows down</b> and O<sub>2</sub> / CO<sub>2</sub> and pH levels return to normal
* <b>Low blood O</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> / High CO</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> / low pH levels </b>(during <b>exercise</b>)

  + Detected by <b>chemoreceptors</b> which send impulses to <b>cardiovascular control centre</b>
  + It sends impulses along <b>sympathetic</b> neurones which secrete the neurotransmitter <b>noradrenaline</b>
  + Noradrenaline binds to receptors on <b>SAN</b> causing it to fire <b>more frequently</b>
  + Heart rate <b>speeds up</b> and O<sub>2</sub> / CO<sub>2</sub> and pH levels return to normal
