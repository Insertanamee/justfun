1.2.11 Practical: Vitamin C Content
-----------------------------------

* Vitamin C is found in green vegetables, fruits, and potatoes
* It is essential for a healthy diet
* The chemical name for vitamin C is <b>ascorbic acid</b>

  + Ascorbic acid is a good <b>reducing</b><b> agent </b>and therefore it is easily <b>oxidised</b>
* Methods for the detection of vitamin C involve <b>titrating </b>it against a solution of an oxidising agent called DCPIP

  + DCPIP is a blue dye that <b>turns colourless</b> in the presence of vitamin C
  + Note that titration is a <b>method of chemical analysis</b> that involves determining the quantity of a substance present by gradually adding another substance

#### Apparatus

* Vitamin C solutions
* 1% DCPIP solution
* Distilled water
* Range of fruit juices
* Measuring cylinder
* Pipette
* Stop watch
* Test tubes

#### Method

1. Make up a series. e.g. six, of known vitamin C concentrations

   * This can be done by serial dilution
2. Use a measuring cylinder to measure out 1 cm<sup>3</sup> of DCPIP solution into a test tube
3. Add one of the vitamin C solutions, drop by drop, to the DCPIP solution using a graduated pipette or burette

   * Shake the tube for a set period of time after adding each drop
   * It is important to keep the shaking time the same for each concentration; this is a <b>control variable</b>
4. When the solution turns colourless record the volume of vitamin C solution added
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the same concentration twice more and calculate a mean
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for each of the known concentrations
7. Results can be plotted as a line of best fit showing the volume of vitamin C needed to decolourise DCPIP against the concentration of vitamin C

   * This is a <b>calibration curve</b> and can be used to find the concentration of vitamin C in unknown samples such as fruit juices
8. Repeat steps 2-6 using fruit juices of unknown concentration; these can be compared to the calibration curve to estimate concentration of vitamin C in each juice sample

#### Risk assessment

* DCPIP is an irritant

  + Avoid contact with the skin
  + Wear eye protection

<i><b>Drops of vitamin C solution of known concentration can be added to DCPIP to determine the volume required for the DCPIP to be decolourised</b></i>

#### Results

* The volume of vitamin C solution required to decolourise DCPIP should <b>decrease </b>as the concentration of the vitamin C solution<b> increases</b>
* The results of the experiment can be plotted on a graph of <b>volume of vitamin C needed to decolourise DCPIP</b> against the <b>concentration of vitamin C</b>

  + The line of best fit for such a graph is known as a <b>calibration curve</b>; unknown substances can be compared to it to gain an <b>estimate </b>of their vitamin C concentration
* This calibration curve produced from this experiment can be used to <b>estimate the concentration of vitamin C</b> in fruit juices

#### Calculating the mass of vitamin C

* It is possible to use the results of the practical described above to calculate the mass of vitamin C present at various points in the investigation

  + This is because we know that 1 cm³ of 1 % vitamin C solution contains 10 mg of vitamin C

* The mass of vitamin C needed to decolourise DCPIP can be calculated as follows:

<b>mass of vitamin C to decolourise 1cm³ of DCPIP = 10 mg × volume of vitamin C used</b>

* Calculating the mass of vitamin C needed to decolourise DCPIP then allows us to calculate the mass of vitamin C present in a fruit juice sample:

<b>mass of vitamin C in fruit juice sample = mass of vitamin C to decolourise 1cm³ of DCPIP × volume of fruit juice used</b>

#### Worked Example

In an investigation into vitamin C concentration a mean of 0.6 cm<sup>3</sup> of a 1 % vitamin C solution was needed to decolourise a 1 cm<sup>3</sup> DCPIP sample. A mean of 1.4 cm<sup>3</sup> of a fruit juice was needed to decolourise the same volume of DCPIP.

Calculate the mass of vitamin C needed to decolourise 1 cm<sup>3</sup> DCPIP, and the mass of DCPIP present in the fruit juice sample.

<b>Answer:</b>  
  
<b>Step 1: calculate the mass of vitamin C needed to decolorise 1 cm</b><sup><b>3</b></sup><b> DCPIP</b>

mass to decolourise DCPIP = 10 mg × volume of vitamin C used

= 10 x 0.6

= 6 mg

<b>Step 2: calculate the mass of vitamin C in the fruit juice sample</b>

mass in fruit juice sample = mass of vitamin C to decolourise 1cm³ of DCPIP × volume of fruit juice used

= 6 x 1.4

= 8.4 mg
