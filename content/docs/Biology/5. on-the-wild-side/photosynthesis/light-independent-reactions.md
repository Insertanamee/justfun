Light-independent Reactions
---------------------------

* The <b>light-independent</b> <b>reactions </b>of photosynthesis are sometimes referred to as the <b>Calvin cycle</b>
* The reactions produce complex organic molecules such as

  + <b>Starch</b> for storage
  + <b>Sucrose</b> for transport
  + <b>Cellulose</b> for making cell walls
* The light-independent reactions do not require energy from light but do require <b>ATP </b>and <b>reduced NADP</b> from the light-dependent reactions
* There are three main steps within the light-independent reactions

  1. <b>Carbon dioxide</b> is combined with <b>ribulose bisphosphate</b> (RuBP), a 5-carbon (5C) compound; this yields two molecules of <b>glycerate 3-phosphate</b> (GP), a 3-carbon (3C) compound
  2. <b>GP is reduced</b> to <b>glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate </b>(GALP), another 3C compound,<b> </b>in a reaction involving reduced NADP and ATP
  3. <b>RuBP is</b> <b>regenerated</b> from GALP in reactions that use ATP

#### Carbon dioxide and RuBP are combined

* Carbon dioxide combines with a 5C sugar known as <b>RuBP</b> in a reaction catalysed by the enzyme <b>rubisco</b>
* The resulting 6-carbon (6C) compound is <b>unstable</b> and splits in two
* This results in two molecules of a 3C compound known as <b>glycerate 3-phosphate </b>(GP)
* The carbon dioxide has been <b>‘fixed’</b>, meaning that<b> </b>it has been removed from the external environment and become part of a molecule inside the plant cell

#### Reduction of glycerate 3-phosphate

* <b>Energy from ATP</b> and <b>hydrogen from reduced NADP, </b>both produced during the light-dependent reactions, are used to <b>reduce</b> the two molecules of <b>GP</b> to two 3C molecule known as <b>GALP</b>
* Some of the carbons in GALP go towards the production of <b>useful organic molecules such as glucose</b>, while the rest remain in the Calvin cycle to allow the <b>regeneration of RuBP</b>

  + Two molecules of GALP contain six carbon atoms, five of which are needed to regenerate RuBP; this means that for every turn through the Calvin cycle only one sixth of a molecule of glucose is produced
  + Glucose is a 6-carbon molecule, so <b>six turns of the Calvin cycle are required to produce one molecule of glucose</b>

#### Regeneration of ribulose bisphosphate

* Five sixths<b> </b>of the GALP molecules are used to <b>regenerate RuBP</b>
* This process<b> requires ATP</b>
