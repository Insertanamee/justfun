Habituation
-----------

* Animals must <b>respond to changes</b> in their <b>external</b> and <b>internal</b> environments in order to survive

  + Changes in the environment, or <b>stimuli </b>(singular<b> stimulus</b>) are detected by specialised <b>receptor cells</b>
  + Receptor cells send <b>signals</b> via either the<b> nervous system </b>or the <b>hormonal system</b> to the body's co-ordination centres in the<b> brain</b> or <b>spinal cord</b>
  + Signals are then sent on to the parts of the body which respond, known as the <b>effectors</b>
* The process of detecting and responding to stimuli <b>requires energy</b>, so it is important that animals don't <b>waste energy responding to non-threatening stimuli</b>

  + Animals need to conserve energy for essential processes that increase their survival chances
* If a stimulus is <b>repeated many times</b> with <b>no negative outcome,</b> then an animal will learn <b>not to respond to it</b>; this process is known as <b>habituation</b>

  + An animal that doesn't respond to a stimulus is said to be <b>habituated</b> to that stimulus
* Examples of habituation include

  + Humans no longer noticing a new smell or sound after a period of exposure
  + Wild animals losing their fear of humans after regular non-harmful contact
  + Animals learning not to be alarmed by the presence of non-predatory species
* If a stimulus to which an animal has become habituated <b>changes,</b> then the nervous system will respond to it again

  + E.g. a constant low-level sound that suddenly becomes louder

#### The process of habituation

* Animals <b>become habituated</b> due to <b>changes in the transmission of nerve impulses</b> from one neurone to the next

  + Nerve impulses are transmitted across synapses by the diffusion of <b>chemical neurotransmitters</b>
  + Neurotransmitters are released at the presynaptic membrane in response to an <b>influx of calcium ions</b>
* When habituation has taken place <b>fewer calcium ions</b> move into the presynaptic neurone on arrival of a nerve impulse
* As a result, <b>less neurotransmitter</b> is released and <b>an action potential is less likely </b>to be generated in the postsynaptic neurone

  + Fewer molecules of neurotransmitter bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane
  + Fewer sodium ion channels open
  + Fewer sodium ions move into the axon and the charge inside the axon remains negative
  + Threshold potential is not reached
* The nerve impulse therefore <b>does not reach the effector</b> organ and the animal <b>does not respond</b> to the stimulus

Practical: Investigating Habituation to a Stimulus
--------------------------------------------------

* Habituation to a stimulus can be studied by <b>measuring the changes in an animal's response to a non-harmful stimulus</b> e.g.

  + Snails often respond to a stimulus by <b>withdrawing into their shell</b>, waiting to <b>emerge again</b> until the harmful stimulus is likely to be gone
  + As snails become habituated to a stimulus the <b>time taken for them to re-emerge</b> from their shells after a stimulus <b>gets shorter</b>

#### Apparatus

* Snail
* A soft object with which to provide a stimulus e.g. a damp cotton bud or a blade of grass
* Stopwatch

#### Method

1. Place a snail on a clean, flat surface and give it time to emerge from its shell

   * The <b>same surface</b> should be used throughout the experiment
   * Ensure that <b>humidity remains the same</b> throughout as snails will withdraw in a dry environment
2. Gently brush the snail's head with a damp cotton bud or blade of grass

   * It is expected that the snail will withdraw into its shell in response to the touch
3. Start the stopwatch and measure the time taken until the snail re-emerges from the shell and fully extends its eye-stalks again
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 10-15 times, recording the time taken until full re-emergence each time

   * Ensure that the <b>same soft object</b> is used throughout and that the <b>location of the touch on the snail's body remains the same</b>
   * Waiting for full extension of the eye stalks ensures that the <b>same end-point</b> is used each time
5. Plot a graph of touch number against time taken for full re-emergence

   * The graph would be expected to show a <b>gradual decrease in the time taken for full re-emergence</b> as the snail becomes habituated to the stimulus

* Note that snails are living organisms and so <b>welfare considerations</b> should be taken into account when using them for experimental purposes

  + Snails should be <b>returned to a suitable environment</b> that replicates their natural habitat at the end of the experiment

    - If snails were taken from a garden or the school grounds then they should be returned to the <b>exact location from which they were removed</b>
  + Any handling and transfer of snails should be carried out <b>gently and quickly</b>
  + Snails should not be exposed to <b>high temperatures</b> or an overly <b>dry environment</b>
