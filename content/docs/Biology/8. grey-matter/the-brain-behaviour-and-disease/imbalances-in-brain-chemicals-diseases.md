Imbalances in Brain Chemicals Leading to Diseases
-------------------------------------------------

* <b>Neurotransmitters</b> are chemicals that transmit nerve impulses across synapses
* Some disorders and diseases are linked to an <b>imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain</b>
* Two examples are

  + <b>Parkinson's Disease</b>
  + <b>Depression</b>

#### Parkinson's disease

* <b>Parkinson's disease</b> is a brain disorder that affects the <b>co-ordination of movement</b>, caused by the <b>loss of neurones</b> in some parts of the brain
* Symptoms include

  + A tremor to the specific parts of the body
  + Slow movement
  + Stiff and inflexible muscles
  + Difficulties with balance
  + Changes to speech
* The lost neurones normally produce the neurotransmitter <b>dopamine</b>

  + Dopamine is involved in <b>muscle control</b>
* Individuals that suffer from Parkinson's disease produce <b>insufficient amounts</b> of dopamine due to the loss of dopamine-producing neurones

  + <b>Less dopamine is released </b>into the synaptic cleft meaning less is able to bind with receptors on the postsynaptic membrane
  + <b>Fewer sodium channels on the membrane are opened </b>so depolarisation of the postsynaptic neurone does not occur
  + This leads to <b>fewer </b>action potentials which creates the symptoms such as tremors and slow movement
* Different types of <b>drugs</b> can be used to treat this disease

  + Dopamine <b>agonists</b>

    - Produce the same effect as dopamine by binding to and activating the dopamine receptors on the postsynaptic membrane
  + Dopamine <b>precursors</b>

    - These are chemicals that can be converted into dopamine in the neurones
    - E.g. L-dopa
  + Enzyme inhibitors

    - Monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) inhibitors inhibit the activity of enzymes that would normally break down dopamine in the synaptic cleft, raising levels of dopamine present in the brain
* Research into other treatments for Parkinson's disease is currently ongoing, with some promising future possibilities in the areas of

  + <b>Gene therapy</b>

    - This would involve the addition of genes to the affected cells in the brain to either increase dopamine production or prevent the destruction of dopamine-producing cells
  + <b>Stem cell therapy</b>

    - Stem cells could be used to replace the lost dopamine-producing cells in the brain

#### Depression

* Low levels of the neurotransmitter <b>serotonin </b>have been <b>linked to depression</b>

  + Serotonin transmits nerve impulses through the<b> areas of the brain that control mood</b>
  + Low levels of serotonin increase episodes of depression
* Other brain chemicals linked to depression include <b>noradrenaline</b> and <b>dopamine</b>
* Some drugs that have been developed for the treatment of depression, known as antidepressants, work by <b>increasing the levels of relevant neurotransmitters</b> in the brain

  + SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are a class of antidepressant that <b>prevent the uptake of serotonin at synapses;</b> this increases the overall levels of serotonin in the brain
  + TCAs (tricyclic antidepressants) <b>increase levels of both serotonin and noradrenaline</b> in the brain
  + MAOB inhibitors<b> inhibit enzymes that would otherwise break down neurotransmitters</b> in the synaptic clefts in the brain
