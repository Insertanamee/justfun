Sustainability & Plant Materials
--------------------------------

* <b>Sustainability</b> refers to the using resources in such a way that the requirements of the <b>current generation</b> are met <b>without depleting</b> these resources for future generations
* This requires the use of <b>renewable resources</b> - which can be used without the resource running out

  + An example would be <b>solar energy</b> - it will not run out in our lifetime as the sun will continue to shine every day for several billion more years
* <b>Fossil fuels</b> are an example of a <b>non-renewable </b>resource, as they could potentially run out if we use them too fast (since it takes millions of years for fossil fuels to form)
* <b>Sustainable practices </b>are those that minimise the damage done to the environment and its resources, to ensure that there will be something left for the next generation

  + An example would be <b>replanting trees</b> after logging
* <b>Unsustainable practices</b> are limited by a finite supply of resources

  + An example is the use of fossil fuels to make <b>oil-based plastics</b>

#### Plant fibres and Sustainability

* Using <b>plant fibres</b> to make products such as ropes and fabric is <b>more sustainable</b> than using oil-based plastics
* <b>Less fossil fuels</b> are used and plants can be <b>replanted</b> for the next generation
* Plant fibres are <b>biodegradable</b>, unlike most oil-based plastics, which means the products made from these fibres can be <b>broken down by microbes</b> to minimise environmental pollution
* Extracting and processing oil is an expensive and difficult procedure compared to growing and processing plants, making plant-based products <b>easier</b> and <b>cheaper</b> to produce in developing countries
* However, the ropes made from plant fibres are typically not as strong as plastic ones

#### Starch and Sustainability

* Plants store excess sugars as <b>starch</b> in their cells
* Starch can be used to make <b>bioplastics</b> which is <b>more sustainable</b> than making oil-based plastics
* It does <b>not require as much fossil fuels</b> to be burned to produce them and the crop plants can be <b>replanted</b> (renewable resource)
* Starch can also be used to make <b>bioethanol</b>, which can be used as a fuel for vehicles
* Using starch to produce biofuels is <b>more sustainable </b>than producing them from oil
