Development of Drug Testing
---------------------------

* Whenever new drugs are developed, they first need to be <b>tested</b> for effectiveness and side-effects, before they can be sold to the general public
* These are known as <b>clinical trials</b> and are crucial to avoid exposing the public to drugs that may pose a risk to their health
* Drug testing has not always been this scientific or regulated in the past

#### Digitalis soup

* <b>William Withering</b> was an English scientist from the 1700s
* He is best known for his work on using <b>digitalis</b> as a treatment for swelling caused by heart failure (known as <b>dropsy</b>)
* Withering treated his patients with an extract made from <b>foxgloves</b>, which contains the drug <b>digitalis</b>
* Foxglove is <b>poisonous to humans</b>, so he made different versions of his remedy containing <b>different concentrations </b>of digitalis
* These versions were called his <b>digitalis soup</b>
* He experimented on his patients to find the <b>most effective concentration </b>of digitalis that would treat dropsy without poisoning the patient

#### Modern methods of drug testing

* Modern drug testing protocols are much more rigorous than those of the past
* The first step is <b>modelling</b> the potential effects of the drug using <b>computers</b>
* Next, the drug will be tested on <b>human tissues</b> in a laboratory, before being tested on <b>animals</b>
* Should the drug pass these steps without causing any major problems, then it will continue on to the <b>clinical trial</b> stage where human test subjects will take it
* There are three phases of testing during clinical trials:

  + <b>Phase 1</b> involves a small group of healthy individuals to determine how the body will react to the drug, side effects of the drug and the correct dosage that should be taken
  + <b>Phase 2</b> will be done on a larger group of patients (non-healthy individuals who require the drug) to determine the effectiveness of the drug
  + <b>Phase 3 </b>involves comparing the drug to existing drugs to see if it works any better. A large number of patients are split into two groups, each of which receives either the new drug or the existing one

#### Placebos

* <b>Placebos</b> are typically done during phase 2 of a clinical trial
* Patients are split into two groups - one will receive the drug and the other group will be given a placebo, which<b> looks exactly like the drug</b> but contains <b>no active ingredients</b>

  + The patients are <b>not told </b>which group they are in
* This provides a way for scientists to determine whether the drug actually <b>works</b>
* Certain patients display what is known as the <b>placebo effect</b>

  + This is where a patient will show improvements in their health due to the <b>belief</b> that they are receiving the drug

#### Double blind studies

* These happen during phase 2 and 3 of clinical trials
* Double blind means that<b> neither the patient nor the doctor</b> knows which patient is receiving the drug or the placebo
* This reduces the effect that the attitude of either doctor or patient may have on the results

  + For example, in some cases, a doctor may believe a patient is improving more if they know the patient is receiving the drug
