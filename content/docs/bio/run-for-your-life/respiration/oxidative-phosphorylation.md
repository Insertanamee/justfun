Oxidative Phosphorylation
-------------------------

* <b>Oxidative phosphorylation</b> is the last stage of aerobic respiration

  + It takes place at the <b>inner mitochondrial membrane</b>
  + It results in the <b>production of many molecules of ATP</b> and the <b>production of water from oxygen</b>
* The current model for oxidative phosphorylation is the <b>chemiosmotic theory</b>

  + The model states that <b>energy from electrons</b> is passed through a chain of proteins in the membrane, known as the <b>electron transport chain</b>
  + This energy is used to <b>pump protons (hydrogen ions) against their concentration gradient</b> into the intermembrane space
  + The protons are then allowed to <b>flow by facilitated diffusion</b> through a channel enzyme called <b>ATP synthase</b> into the matrix
  + The energy of the protons flowing down their concentration gradient is harnessed (a bit like water flowing through a hydroelectric damn) resulting in the <b>phosphorylation of ADP into ATP</b> by ATP synthase

#### Outline of oxidative phosphorylation

* Hydrogen atoms are donated by reduced NAD (NADH) and reduced FAD (FADH<sub>2</sub>) from the Krebs Cycle
* Hydrogen atoms <b>split into protons (H</b><sup><b>+</b></sup><b> ions) and electrons</b>
* The high energy electrons enter the <b>electron transport chain</b> and <b>release energy</b> as they move through the electron transport chain
* The energy released is used to <b>transport protons</b> across the inner mitochondrial membrane <b>from the matrix into the intermembrane space</b>
* A <b>concentration gradient</b> of protons is established between the intermembrane space and the matrix
* The protons return to the matrix via <b>facilitated diffusion</b> through the <b>channel enzyme ATP synthase</b>
* The movement of protons down their concentration gradient provides energy for <b>ATP synthesis</b>
* <b>Oxygen</b> acts as the '<b>final electron accepto</b>r' and combines with protons and electrons at the end of the electron transport chain to <b>form water</b>

#### The electron transport chain

* The electron transport chain is made up of a <b>series of membrane proteins</b>/ electron carriers
* They are positioned close together which allows the electrons to pass from carrier to carrier
* The inner membrane of the mitochondria is impermeable to hydrogen ions so these electron carriers are required to <b>pump the protons across the membrane</b> to establish the concentration gradient

<i><b>Oxidative phosphorylation via the chemiosmotic theory occurs on the inner mitochondrial membrane and requires NADH and FADH</b></i><sub><i><b>2</b></i></sub><i><b> from the Krebs Cycle. It produces water and many molecules of ATP</b></i>

* Oxidative phosphorylation <b>uses energy</b> from reduced NAD and FAD to <b>produce ATP</b>

  + <b>3 ATP</b> molecules for every reduced <b>NAD</b> molecule
  + <b>2 ATP</b> molecules for every reduced <b>FAD</b> molecule
* For every molecule of glucose, a total of <b>38 ATP molecules</b> can be produced during aerobic respiration

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

Examiners often ask why oxygen is so important for aerobic respiration. Oxygen acts as the <b>final electron acceptor. </b>Without oxygen the electron transport chain cannot continue as the electrons have nowhere to go. Without oxygen accepting the electrons (and hydrogen ions) the reduced coenzymes NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> cannot be oxidised to regenerate NAD and FAD, so they can’t be used in further hydrogen transport.

It is important to use the correct terminology when describing hydrogen; ensure you understand when to use "hydrogen" and when to use "hydrogen ions/protons".
