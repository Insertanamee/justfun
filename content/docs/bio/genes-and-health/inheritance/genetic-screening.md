Genetic Screening: Uses
-----------------------

* Some circumstances, e.g. in a pregnancy where there is a family history of a genetic disorder, may require individuals to determine if they have a particular allele present in their genome
* This can be determined by <b>genetic screening</b>
* There are three main uses of genetic screening

  + Identifying individuals who are <b>carrying an allele at a gene locus for a particular disorder</b>
  + The screening of embryos prior to implantation during fertility treatment; this is <b>Preimplantation</b> <b>Genetic Diagnosis </b>(PGD)
  + Testing a foetus before birth; this is <b>prenatal testing</b>

#### Identification of carriers

* Carrier testing is offered to individuals with a <b>history </b>of genetic disorders in their family
* It can show whether people who have no symptoms <b>carry the allele</b> for particular disorders, such as cystic fibrosis
* Couples can be tested prior to having children to <b>determine the probability of future children inheriting the disorder</b>
* Benefits

  + Families can make<b> informed decisions</b> before having children
  + Women can decide whether to have <b>prenatal testing</b> during pregnancy

#### Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis

* IVF, or <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation is a type of fertility treatment during which <b>fertilisation is carried out in the lab; </b>embryos produced in this way can be <b>implanted into the uterus</b> where they develop into a foetus
* PGD involves <b>analysis of the DNA of an embryo</b> prior to implanting it into the uterus

  + The sample of DNA to be analysed can be obtained by taking<b> cell samples from</b> <b>embryos</b> produced during IVF
* Benefits

  + Reduces the chances of having a baby with a genetic disorder
  + It avoids abortion as it is carried out before implantation of the embryo

#### Prenatal testing

* Prenatal testing is offered to pregnant women with a family history of genetic disorders
* It involves testing the foetus for genetic diseases
* The DNA can be obtained by <b>chorionic villus sampling</b> or <b>amniocentesis</b> of embryos and foetuses in the uterus
* Chorionic villus sampling

  + This involves removing and testing a small sample of cells <b>from the placenta </b>using a fine needle
  + The cells contain foetal DNA which can be <b>analysed for genetic disorders</b>, allowing parents to make informed decisions about the pregnancy and foetus
  + It is carried out at around 11-14 weeks of pregnancy
  + The process has a  1-2 % risk of miscarriage
* Amniocentesis

  + This involves removing and testing a small sample of cells <b>from amniotic fluid</b> using a fine needle

    - The amniotic fluid is the fluid that surrounds the foetus within the uterus
  + The fluid contains <b>foetal cells</b> which contain <b>DNA to be analysed</b>
  + It is carried out at around 15-20 weeks of pregnancy
  + The procedure has a 1% risk of miscarriage
* Benefits

  + The tests allow parents to make informed decisions
  + Results can help parents prepare for the future care of the child, including medical treatment

Genetic Screening: Social & Ethical Issues
------------------------------------------

* Genetic screening comes with a range of different social and ethical issues
* As genetic screening can leave future parents with many questions, <b>genetic counsellors</b> are available to help

  + Counsellors can be seen <b>before screening </b>has occurred; they may discuss the following with the prospective parents

    - The probability of the couple having a child with a genetic disorder
    - Termination of the pregnancy
    - Therapeutic treatments possible for the child
    - Financial implications of having the child
    - Effect on existing siblings
    - Ethical issues
  + After screening the counsellors will read the results and <b>explain them </b>to the future parents

* Each use of genetic screening brings <b>potential concerns</b> that should be considered

  + Identification of Carriers

    - Finding out you are a carrier can cause <b>emotional stress</b> and upset
    - It may impact your ability to find a partner
    - <b>Other genetic disorders</b> may be identified
    - <b>Employers </b>and<b> insurance companies </b>may use the data against an individual
    - The tests are <b>not always 100 % accurate;</b> false positives or negatives may be given
  + Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis

    - There are concerns it could lead to "designer babies" where <b>parents select embryos</b> with certain traits such as eye colour or sex
    - False results could lead to inaccurate information and <b>poor decisions being made</b> about the fate of embryos
  + Prenatal testing

    - Each procedure brings <b>risk of miscarriage</b>
    - False results could provide inaccurate information and <b>poor decisions</b> being made
    - There are <b>ethical implications</b> involved if parents decide to abort the fetus
