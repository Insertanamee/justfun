Evolutionary Race Between Pathogens & Host
------------------------------------------

* Vertebrates have evolved over millions of years to have immune systems that are capable of dealing with a wide range of different pathogens
* <b>Pathogens</b>, however, have also evolved and have developed different ways of <b>evading their host's immune system</b>
* This battle between host and pathogen is known as an <b>evolutionary race</b>; each organism develops new ways in which to have an advantage over the other

  + This evolutionary race is sometimes referred to as an <b>evolutionary arms race</b>
* Evasion mechanisms developed by pathogens serve as support for this theory

#### HIV evasion mechanisms

* The virus <b>kills helper T cells</b> after it infects them which reduces the number of cells that could detect the presence of the virus and activate the production of antibodies
* HIV shows <b>antigenic variability</b> due to the high mutation rate in the genes coding for antigen proteins

  + This forms <b>new strains</b> of the virus which each require a new primary immune response

    - Memory cells for one strain <b>will not recognise</b> the antigens of another strain
* The virus <b>prevents</b> infected cells from<b> presenting their antigens</b> on the cell surface membrane, making it very difficult for the relevant white blood cells to recognise and destroy the infected cells

#### Mycobacterium tuberculosis evasion mechanisms

* Once engulfed by phagocytes in the lungs the bacteria produce substances that will <b>prevent a</b> lysosome from fusing with the phagocytic vacuole

  + This prevents the bacteria from being broken down by digestive enzymes, leaving them to <b>multiply</b> within the phagocyte
* As with HIV the bacteria can <b>disrupt antigen presentation</b> in infected phagocytes, making it difficult for the immune system to recognise and destroy these cells
