Non-specific Immune Responses
-----------------------------

* There are two types of immune response in the body once a pathogen enters

  + <b>Non-specific</b>

    - This response is the same, regardless of the pathogen that invades the body
  + <b>Specific</b>

    - This is a response specific to a particular pathogen
    - The immune system is able to recognise specific pathogens due to the presence of <b>antigens</b> on their cell surface

      * Antigens are molecules such as <b>proteins</b> or glycoproteins located on the surface of cells; their role is to act as an ID tag, <b>identifying a cell as being 'self' or 'non-self'</b>

        + Pathogens have<b> non-self antigens</b>, so the immune system recognises them as <b>not belonging to the body</b>
* When a pathogen invades tissue the non-specific immune response begins immediately; this includes

  + Inflammation
  + Interferons
  + Phagocytosis

#### Inflammation

* The surrounding area of a wound can sometimes become <b>swollen, warm and painful</b> to touch; this is<b> inflammation</b>
* Body cells called <b>mast cells</b> respond to tissue damage by secreting the molecule <b>histamine</b>

  + Histamine is a <b>chemical signalling molecule</b> that enables <b>cell signalling</b>, or communication between cells
* Histamine stimulates the following responses

  + Vasodilation increases blood flow through capillaries
  + <b>Capillary walls become 'leaky'</b>, or<b> more permeable</b>, allowing fluid to enter the tissues and creating swelling

    - Some plasma proteins leave the blood when the capillaries become more permeable
  + <b>Phagocytes</b> leave the blood and enter the tissue to <b>engulf foreign particles</b>
  + Cells release <b>cytokines</b>, another cell signalling molecule that triggers an immune response in the infected area

#### Interferons

* Cells infected by viruses produce <b>anti-viral proteins</b> called <b>interferons</b>
* Interferons <b>prevent viruses from spreading</b> to uninfected cells

  + They <b>inhibit</b> the production of viral proteins, preventing the virus from replicating
  + They <b>activate </b>white blood cells involved with the <b>specific immune response</b> to destroy infected cells
  + They <b>increase the non-specific immune response </b>e.g. by promoting inflammation

#### Phagocytosis

* <b>Phagocytes</b> are a type of white blood cell responsible for <b>removing dead cells and invasive microorganisms</b>; they do this by engulfing and digesting them

  + The process of engulfing and digesting is known as <b>phagocytosis</b>
* Phagocytes travel throughout the body and can leave the blood by <b>squeezing through capillary walls</b>
* During an infection they are released in <b>large numbers</b>
* Mode of action

  + <b>Chemicals</b> released by pathogens, as well as chemicals released by the body cells under attack, e.g. histamine,<b> attract phagocytes</b> to the site where the pathogens are located
  + They move towards pathogens and <b>recognise</b> <b>the antigens</b> on the surface of the pathogen as being <b>non-self</b>
  + The <b>cell surface membrane</b> of a phagocyte extends out and around the pathogen, <b>engulfing it</b> and trapping the pathogen within a <b>phagocytic vacuole</b>

    - This part of the process is known as <b>endocytosis</b>
  + Enzymes are released into the phagocytic vacuole when <b>lysosomes</b> <b>fuse</b> with it
  + These digestive enzymes, which includes lysozyme, <b>digest</b> <b>the pathogen</b>
  + After digesting the pathogen, the phagocyte will <b>present the antigens</b> of the pathogen on its cell surface membrane

    - The phagocyte becomes what is known as an <b>antigen presenting cell</b>
  + The presentation of antigens<b> initiates the specific immune response</b>
