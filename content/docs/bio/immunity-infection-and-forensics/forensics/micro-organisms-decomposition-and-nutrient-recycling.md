Micro-organisms: Decomposition & Nutrient Recycling
---------------------------------------------------

* Dead plants and animals are <b>broken down</b> by microorganisms such as <b>bacteria</b> and <b>fungi</b>

  + These organisms are known as decomposers
* These decomposers <b>secrete enzymes</b> that break <b>large organic molecules</b> down into <b>smaller ones</b>

  + These small molecules, such as glucose, can be broken down further during <b>respiration</b>
* The microorganisms involved in decomposition produce <b>CO</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> </b>and <b>methane</b> which are <b>released</b> into the atmosphere
* Carbon dioxide can then be <b>absorbed </b>by green plants which will <b>fix the carbon</b> back into carbohydrates during <b>photosynthesis</b>
