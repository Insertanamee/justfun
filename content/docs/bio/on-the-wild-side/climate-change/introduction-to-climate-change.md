Introduction to Climate Change
------------------------------

* The termÂ <b>climate</b> refers to the <b>weather conditions</b> in a region over a <b>long period of time</b> i.e. several decades
* When the weather conditions in a region change significantly over a long period of time, this is <b>climate change</b>
* Changes to the climate have <b>occurred frequently throughout Earth's history</b> due to changes in factors such as atmospheric gas concentrations and volcanic activity, but climate changes that have occurred <b>since the mid-1800s</b> are thought to be the result of <b>human activities</b>

  + The term climate change is most often used today to refer to <b>global warming</b> that is occurring as a result of human activities
* Changes to <b>global climate patterns</b> result in alterations to <b>local weather patterns</b> e.g. rainfall and temperatures
