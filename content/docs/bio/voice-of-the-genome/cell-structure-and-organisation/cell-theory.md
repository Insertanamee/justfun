Cell Theory
-----------

* Until microscopes became powerful enough to view individual cells, no-one knew for certain what living organisms were made from
* A scientist called <b>Robert Hooke</b> is thought to be the <b>first person to view cells, </b>using the term 'cell' to describe these newly discovered structures
* Matthias <b>Schleiden</b> and Theodor <b>Schwann</b> were two other scientists who studied animal and plant cells

  + In 1837 they came up with the idea that <b>all living organisms are made of cells</b>
  + This idea is known as <b>‘cell theory’</b>
  + The cell theory is a <b>unifying concept</b> in biology, meaning that it is <b>universally accepted</b>
* Cell theory includes <b>three main ideas</b>

  + <b>All living organisms</b> are made up of <b>one or more cells</b>
  + Cells are the <b>basic functional unit</b> in living organisms
  + <b>New cells</b> are produced from <b>pre-existing cells</b>

* The cells of all living organisms share some <b>common features</b>

  + Cell surface membrane
  + Cytoplasm
  + DNA
  + Ribosomes
* Beyond these common features different cell types contain <b>different structural elements</b> and combinations of organelles, e.g.

  + Prokaryotic cells have no internal membranes and smaller ribosomes
  + Eukaryotic cells have several internal membrane-bound organelles and larger ribosomes
* When examined under a <b>microscope</b> it is possible to see the <b>ultrastructure</b> of different cell types

  + Cell ultrastructure refers to the internal structures of the cell
