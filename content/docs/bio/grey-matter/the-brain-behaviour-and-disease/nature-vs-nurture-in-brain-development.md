Nature vs Nurture in Brain Development
--------------------------------------

* <b>Brain development </b>refers to the <b>growth</b> of the brain and the formation of connections between neurones, or <b>neural pathways</b>
* There are a number of <b>factors that can be measured</b> to determine brain development

  + Brain size
  + Number of neurones
  + The level at which the brain is functioning
* Brain development is influenced by both <b>genetic </b>and <b>environmental factors</b>

  + The impact of genetic factors can be referred to as the impact of '<b>nature</b>' on development while the impact of environmental factors can be referred to that of '<b>nurture</b>'
* It is <b>very difficult</b> to determine which of <b>nature or nurture</b> has the greatest influence on brain development

  + The <b>genes and environment</b> of an organism <b>interact</b> with each other and it is difficult to separate out the impacts of each

    - A scientist would have to <b>completely remove</b> the influence of one of the factors in order to investigate the other; an almost impossible task!
  + There are <b>many different</b> genes and environmental factors to investigate

#### Methods for investigating the effects of nature & nurture

* <b>Animal experiments</b>

  + Scientists study the effects that <b>different environments</b> have on the brain development of individuals of the <b>same species</b>

    - The <b>environment in which animals live can be manipulated</b> to allow the investigation of the impact of environment on brain development

      * Animals of the same species would have <b>similar genes</b>, therefore making it <b>more likely</b> that differences in brain development would be due to the changed <b>environmental factors</b>
  + Genetic modification can be used to switch off the function of a certain gene; raising genetically altered animals alongside unaltered animals in a similar environment allows the<b> impact of genetic factors to be studied</b>

    - Any differences observed in the brain development of the two groups would most likely be due to <b>genetic factors</b>
    - This type of genetic engineering is considered ethical in animals such as mice, but cannot be carried out in humans

* <b>Twin studies</b>

  + <b>Identical twins</b> are <b>genetically identical </b>to each other so if they are raised in <b>different environments</b> then any differences in brain development would be due to <b>nurture</b>, while <b>similarities</b> would be due to <b>nature</b>

    - E.g. the <b>IQ scores</b> of identical twins are very similar which implies that nature plays an important role in intelligence
  + When identical twins are raised together <b>their environments will be very similar</b>, so it can be very difficult to distinguish between the impacts of nature and nurture

    - Scientists will often use <b>non-identical twins</b> raised in a similar environment as a <b>control group</b> when studying identical twins raised together in the same environment

      * Non-identical twins are genetically different
    - This cancels out the effect of the environment, meaning any <b>observable difference</b> in brain development between the identical and non-identical twins will be likely due to <b>nature</b>

      * Traits that are more common in identical twins than non-identical twins are likely to be <b>determined by largely genetic factors</b>
      * Traits that<b> </b>show little difference between the pairs of twins are likely to be <b>determined by largely environmental factors</b>

* <b>Cross-cultural studies</b>

  + Different cultures provide <b>different environmental influences</b> on the brain development of children
  + Scientists can study the effect of this by comparing large groups of children of a similar age from different cultural backgrounds
  + Any <b>differences</b> in brain development are <b>more likely</b> to be due to <b>nurture</b>, whereas any <b>similarities</b> will more likely be due to <b>nature</b>

* <b>Newborn studies</b>

  + The environment outside the womb would not have impacted the brain development of a newborn baby
  + The <b>level of brain development</b> that babies are born with are therefore more likely due to <b>nature</b> than nurture

    - E.g. babies are born with a variety of <b>basic abilities</b> (e.g. crying, feeding, recognising faces) which suggests that <b>nature</b> plays an important role in the development of these abilities
    - They do not have the ability to <b>speak</b> which implies that <b>nurture</b> plays an important role

* <b>Brain damage studies</b>

  + Brain damage in adults cannot be easily repaired as the brain is fully developed, however, since a child's brain is still developing, they provide an opportunity for scientists to study the <b>effects of brain damage on development</b>
  + Scientists can choose a <b>particular characteristic</b> and then compare the development of that trait in children born with and without brain damage

    - If children born with brain damage <b>show the development </b>of that characteristic, then it is more likely due to <b>nurture</b> than nature

      * E.g. young children with brain damage to the area associated with <b>language</b> show a delay in language milestones when compared to children without brain damage, but they catch up to the level of children without brain damage by the age of 5, suggesting that <b>nurture</b> plays an important role in language development
    - If the characteristic <b>doesn't develop</b> in brain damaged children, it is more likely to be due to <b>nature</b>
