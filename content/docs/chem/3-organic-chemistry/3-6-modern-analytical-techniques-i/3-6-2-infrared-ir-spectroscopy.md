Interpreting an IR Spectrum
---------------------------

* <b>Infrared (IR) spectroscopy </b>is a technique used to identify compounds based on changes in <b>vibrations</b> of atoms when they <b>absorb</b> IR of certain <b>frequencies</b>
* A <b>spectrophotometer </b>irradiates the sample with electromagnetic waves in the infrared region and then detects the <b>intensity</b> of the wavelength of IR radiation which goes through the sample
* All organic molecules absorb IR radiation and depending on which energies of radiation are absorbed, bonds between atoms will vibrate by <b>stretching</b>, <b>bending </b>and <b>twisting</b>
* The molecules will only vibrate at a specific frequency
* The <b>resonance frequency </b>is the specific frequency at which the molecules will vibrate to stimulate larger vibrations
* Depending on the rest of the molecule, each vibration will absorb specific wavelengths of IR radiation which are also shown as the <b>reciprocal </b>of the wavelength

  + This unit is called the <b>wavenumber </b>(cm<sup>-1</sup>)
* Particular absorbance have characteristic <b>widths </b>(broad or sharp) and <b>intensities </b>(strong or weak)

  + For example, hydrogen bonds cause the O-H bonds in alcohols and carboxylic acids to be <b>broad</b> whereas the C-O bond in carbonyl (C=O) groups have a strong, sharp absorbance peak
* The energies absorbed by different functional groups are given as a range and an unknown compound can be identified by comparing its IR spectrum to the IR spectrum of a known compound

#### Worked Example

<b>Analysing IR Spectra</b>

Look at the two infrared spectra below and determine which one corresponds to propanone and which one to propan-2-ol

<b>Answer</b>

* IR spectrum <b>A</b> is <b>propanone </b>and spectrum <b>B</b> is <b>propan-2-ol</b>.

  + In IR spectrum <b>A </b>the presence of a strong, sharp absorption around 1710 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponds to the characteristic C=O, carbonyl, group in a ketone.
  + In spectrum <b>B</b> the presence of a strong, broad absorption around 3200-3500 cm<sup>-1</sup> suggests that there is an alcohol group present, which corresponds to the -OH group in propan-2-ol.
