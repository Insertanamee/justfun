Relating Observations to Chemical Equations
-------------------------------------------

* Chemical equations give information about the reaction that is taking place

  + Balanced equations show the number of particles participating in the reaction and the number of products being formed
  + Balanced equations can be used to calculate the number of moles involved in reactions
  + Balanced equations can, also, be used to calculate masses and volumes involved in reactions
  + Ionic equations only show the reacting particles
  + Ionic equations allow you to identify spectator ion

#### Types of reaction

* Chemical equations can be used to determine the type of reaction taking place

<b>Displacement reactions</b>

Br<sub>2</sub> (aq) + 2KI (aq) → I<sub>2</sub> (aq) + 2KBr (aq)

* In this reaction, the more reactive bromine <b>displaces </b>the less reactive iodide in potassium iodide
* This can also be seen in the ionic equation for the reaction

Br<sub>2</sub> (aq) + 2I<sup>-</sup> (aq) → I<sub>2</sub> (aq) + 2Br<sup>-</sup> (aq)

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

The use of chemical equations can help identify risks and hazards in the reaction and suggest appropriate precautions where necessary

For example, the use of aqueous bromine in the above example should suggest the potential use of a fume cupboard and nitrile gloves because:

* Bromine liquid is <b>toxic</b>, <b>corrosive </b>and <b>harmful to the environment</b>
* Bromine water with a concentration of 0.2 mol dm<sup>3</sup> is corrosive
* With a concentration of between 0.06 mol dm<sup>3</sup> and 0.2 mol dm<sup>3</sup>, bromine water is an <b>irritant</b>
* Only below concentrations of 0.06 mol dm<sup>3</sup> is bromine water considered a <b>low hazard</b>

<b>Neutralisation reactions</b>

* These can be identified by the presence of reactant acids and bases as well as the formation of a <b>neutral salt solution </b>and water (and sometimes other compounds such as carbon dioxide)

HCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l)

Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (aq) + 2HNO<sub>3</sub> (aq) → 2NaNO<sub>3</sub> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) + CO<sub>2</sub> (g)

* The ionic equations can more clearly demonstrate the neutralisation of an acid and a base:

H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + OH<sup>-</sup> (aq) → H<sub>2</sub>O (l)

2H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> (aq) → H<sub>2</sub>O (l) + CO<sub>2</sub> (g)

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

For neutralisation reactions, the main hazards are linked to:

* The concentration of the acid
* The type of acid

  + This could mean <b>strong</b>,  e.g. HCl, or <b>weak</b>, e.g. CH<sub>3</sub>COOH
  + This could also mean <b>monoprotic</b>, e.g. HNO<sub>3</sub>, <b>diprotic</b>, e.g. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, or <b>triprotic</b>, e.g. H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
* The concentration of the base
* The strength of the base
* The physical state of the base, e.g. NaOH (s) is arguably considered more corrosive than a high concentration solution of NaOH (aq)

<b>Precipitation reactions</b>

* These are shown by the reaction of two aqueous solutions to form products which include one solid

BaCl<sub>2</sub> (aq) + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (aq) → BaSO<sub>4</sub> (s) + 2NaCl (aq)

* The ionic equation shows the precipitation reactions more clearly as there are no other products considered

Ba<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> (aq) → BaSO<sub>4</sub> (s)

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

A precipitation reaction is a clear example of where consideration for further practical procedures is most obvious

The formation of a solid product should tell you that any purification of the product should include filtering or decanting as a minimum
