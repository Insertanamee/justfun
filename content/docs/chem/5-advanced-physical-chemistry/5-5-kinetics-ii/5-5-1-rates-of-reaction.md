Rates of Reaction - Introduction
--------------------------------

* The <b>rate of reaction</b><b> </b>refers to the change in the amount or concentration of a reactant <b>or</b> product per unit time

  + The units for rate of reaction are mol dm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>
* It can be found by measuring:

  + The mass lost over time
  + The volume of produced over time
  + Colour changes, including by the use of colorimetry
  + pH changes over time
  + Changes in electrical conductivity
* The rate of reaction can be calculated by:

#### Rate of Reaction

The following general reaction will be used as an example to study the rate of reaction

<b>D (aq) → E (aq) + F (g) </b>

* The rate of reaction at different concentrations of D<sub> </sub>is measured and tabulated

* A <b>directly proportional </b>relationship between the <b>rate</b> of reaction and <b>concentration of D</b> is observed when the results are plotted on a graph:

<i><b>Rate of reaction over various concentrations of D</b></i>

* This leads to a very common rate expression:

<b>Rate ∝ [D]       or       Rate = </b><i><b>k</b></i><b>[D]</b>

* This rate expression means that if the concentration of D is doubled, then the rate doubles
* Equally, if the concentration of D halves, then the rate halves

#### Rate Equations

* The following reaction will be used to discuss rate equations:

<b>A (aq) + B (aq) → C (aq) + D (g) </b>

* The rate equation for this reaction is:

<b>Rate of reaction = </b><i><b>k</b></i><b> [A]</b><sup><i><b>m</b></i></sup><b> [B]</b><sup><i><b>n</b></i></sup>

* Rate equations can only be determined experimentally and cannot be found from the stoichiometric equations
* In the above rate equation:

  + [A] and [B] are the concentrations of the reactants
  + <i>m </i>and <i>n</i> are orders with respect to each reactant involved in the reaction
* Products and catalysts may feature in rate equations
* Intermediates do not feature in rate equations
