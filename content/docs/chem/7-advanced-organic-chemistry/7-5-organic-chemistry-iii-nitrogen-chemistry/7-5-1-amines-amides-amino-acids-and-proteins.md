Amines, Amides & Amino Acids
----------------------------

* <b>Amines</b> can be thought of as derivates of ammonia, in which one or more of the hydrogens is replaced by an alkyl or aryl group
* The number of substituted hydrogens is the basis of classifying amines

![Amine Classification, downloadable AS & A Level Chemistry revision notes](7.5.1-Amine-Classification.png)

<i><b>Classification of amines</b></i>

* Notice the classification is not the same as in alcohols and haloalkanes, where the designation primary, secondary and tertiary is based on the substituents on the <i>carbon</i> atom rather than the <i>nitrogen</i> atom
* If the R group is an alkyl group (methyl, ethyl, etc) then then it is an <b>aliphatic amine;</b> if it is an aryl group (benzene ring or phenyl) then it is an <b>aromatic amine</b>
* Aliphatic and aromatic amines share similar chemical reactions and the aryl group can strongly influence the chemistry and reactivity of the amine group

#### Naming Amines

* Amines can be named using common names or IUPAC systematic names
* The common way to name amines is to use the alkyl (or aryl) prefix followed by <b>-amine</b>
* The IUPAC systematic name uses the numbered prefix <b>amino-</b> followed by the alkane (or aromatic) stem

#### Amides

* <b>Amides </b>are formed from the <b>condensation reaction</b> of <b>carboxylic acids </b>or <b>acyl chlorides </b>with <b>ammonia </b>or <b>amines</b>
* Amides are common in nature such as in proteins where the amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids bond together
* Amides have a general structure of RCONR<sub>2</sub>

<i><b>The general structure of an amide</b></i>

* Amides can be classified as primary, secondary or tertiary amides
* Like amines, this is done as a comparison to ammonia, depending on the number of substitutions on the amide nitrogen

  + Primary amide - one carbon bonded to the amide nitrogen

    - R' and R'' are both hydrogen atoms so one "ammonia" hydrogen has been substituted with the carbonyl group from the RCO portion of the molecule
  + Secondary amide - two carbons bonded to the amide nitrogen (one MUST be the carbonyl carbon)
  + Tertiary amide - three carbons bonded to the amide nitrogen (one MUST be the carbonyl carbon)

<b>Naming primary amides</b>

* For primary amides, we simply add -amide to the stem name

  + e.g. CH<sub>3</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub>

    - Contains two carbons with a C-C (ethan-) and an amide group (-amide)
    - This gives us ethanamide

<b>Naming secondary amides</b>

* For secondary amides, the alkyl chain attached to the nitrogen is added at the start of the chemical name
* This alkyl chain is prefixed with N-
* The chain containing the carbonyl group is named the same as a primary amide

  + e.g. CH3CONH(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)

    - Contains a propyl group on the nitrogen (N-propyl)
    - Contains two carbons with a C-C (ethan-) and an amide group (-amide)
    - This gives us N-propylethanamide

<b>Naming tertiary amides</b>

* For tertiary amides, there are two alkyl chains attached to the nitrogen
* The naming of these chains is the same as secondary amides
* As with standard nomenclature, these chains are listed in alphabetical order and the prefix 'di-' is used if necessary

  + e.g. CH3CONCH<sub>3</sub>(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)

    - Contains a methyl group on the nitrogen (N-methyl)
    - Contains a propyl group on the nitrogen (N-propyl)
    - Contains two carbons with a C-C (ethan-) and an amide group (-amide)
    - This gives us N-methyl-N-propylethanamide

#### Amino acids

* <b>Amino acids</b> are organic compounds that contain two functional groups:

  + A basic <b>amino </b>(-NH<sub>2</sub>) group
  + An acidic <b>carboxylic acid</b> (-COOH) group
* Due to the presence of both a basic and acidic group in amino acids, they are said to be amphoteric

  + They can act as both acids and bases

<b>Naturally occurring amino acids</b>

* 2-aminocarboxylic acids are a type of amino acids in which the amine (-NH<sub>2</sub>) group is bonded to the carbon atom next to the -COOH group
* These type of amino acids form the ‘building blocks’ that make up <b>proteins</b>
* There are 20 naturally occurring amino acids with the general structural formula of <b>RCH(NH2)COOH</b>

* The <b>R </b>group varies in different amino acids and can be:

  + Acidic
  + Basic
  + Neutral
