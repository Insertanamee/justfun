Disproportionation
------------------

#### Disproportionation reactions

* A <b>disproportionation</b> <b>reaction</b> is a reaction in which the same species is simultaneously oxidised and reduced

#### Worked Example

<b>Balancing disproportionation reactions</b>

Balance the disproportionation reaction which takes place when chlorine is added to hot concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide. The products are Cl<sup>- </sup>and ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>ions and water

#### Worked Example

<b>Oxidation and reduction</b>

In each of the following equations, state which reactant has been oxidised and which has been reduced.

1. <b>Na</b><sup><b>+</b></sup><b>+ Cl</b><sup><b>-</b></sup><b> →  NaCl</b>
2. <b>Mg + Fe</b><sup><b>2+</b></sup><b>  →  Mg</b><sup><b>2+</b></sup><b> + Fe</b>
3. <b>CO + Ag</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b>O  →  2Ag + CO</b><sub><b>2</b></sub>

<b>Answer 1:</b>

* Oxidised: Cl<sup>-</sup> as the oxidation state has increased by 1

  + Reduced: Na<sup>+</sup> as the oxidation state has decreased by 1

<b>Answer 2:</b>

* Oxidised: Mg as the oxidation state has increased by 2

  + Reduced: Fe<sup>2+</sup> as the oxidation state has decreased by 2

<b>Answer 3:</b>

* Oxidised: C as it has gained oxygen

  + Reduced: Ag as it has lost oxygen
