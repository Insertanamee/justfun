Halogen Displacement Reactions
------------------------------

* The reactivity of halogens is also shown by their <b>displacement</b> <b>reactions</b> with other halide ions in solutions
* A <b>more</b> <b>reactive </b>halogen can displace a <b>less reactive </b>halogen from a halide solution of the less reactive halogen
* Eg. The addition of chlorine water to a solution of bromine water:

<b>Cl</b><sub><b>2 </b></sub><b>(aq) + 2NaBr (aq) → 2NaCl (aq) + Br</b><sub><b>2 </b></sub><b>(aq)</b>

* The chlorine has displaced the bromine from solution as it is more reactive which can be summarised in the following ionic equation by removing the sodium spectator ions:

<b>Cl</b><sub><b>2 </b></sub><b>(aq) + 2Br</b><sup><b>- </b></sup><b>(aq) → 2Cl</b><sup><b>- </b></sup><b>(aq) + Br</b><sub><b>2 </b></sub><b>(aq)</b>

* Chlorine can also displace iodine from a solution of iodide ions:

<b>Cl</b><sub><b>2 </b></sub><b>(aq) + 2I</b><sup><b>- </b></sup><b>(aq) → 2Cl</b><sup><b>- </b></sup><b>(aq) + I</b><sub><b>2 </b></sub><b>(aq)</b>

We can see these are both redox reactions by taking a look at changes in the oxidation number of each element in the reaction Br and I both change from = -1 → 0 so the bromine and iodine have been oxidised in their respective reactions Cl = 0 → -1 so the chlorine has been reduced in both reactions No change in oxidation number for the sodium

#### Chlorine with Bromides & Iodides

If you add chlorine solution to colourless potassium bromide or potassium iodide solution a displacement reaction occurs:

* The solution becomes <b>yellow</b>-<b>orange</b> as bromine is formed
* The solution becomes <b>brown </b>as iodine is formed
* If an <b>organic solvent</b> is added, such as cyclohexane, the following observations are seen:

  + The organic layer will appear <b>yellow-orange</b> as bromine is formed
  + The organic layer will appear <b>purple</b> as iodine is formed
  + The organic solvent is useful as the the halogens are more soluble in this layer which helps observe the colour changes more easily
* Chlorine is <b>above</b> bromine and iodine in Group 7 so it is more reactive
* Chlorine will <b>displace</b> bromine or iodine from an aqueous solution of the metal halide:

<b>Cl</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> (aq) + 2KBr (aq) → 2KCl (aq) + Br</b><sub><b>2 </b></sub><b>(aq)</b>

chlorine + potassium bromide <b>→</b>  potassium chloride + bromine

<b>Cl</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> (aq) + 2KI (aq) → 2KCl (aq) + I</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> (aq)</b>

chlorine + potassium iodide <b>→</b>  potassium chloride + iodine

#### Bromine with Iodides

* Bromine is above iodine in Group 7 so it is<b> more</b> reactive
* Bromine will displace iodine from an aqueous solution of the metal iodide

bromine + potassium iodide <b>→</b>  potassium bromide + iodine

<b>Br</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> (aq) + 2KI (aq) → 2KBr (aq) + I</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> (aq)</b>

* The reaction will turn <b>brown</b> as iodine is formed
* If an organic solvent is added the organic layer will appear <b>purple</b> as iodine is formed
* We can show that this is a redox reaction by looking at the changes in oxidation numbers:

  + I = -1 → 0 so the iodine has been oxidised
  + Br = 0 → -1 so the bromine has been reduced
  + No change in oxidation number for the potassium
* Rather than writing the full equation, we can also write the ionic equation by removing the potassium spectator ion
