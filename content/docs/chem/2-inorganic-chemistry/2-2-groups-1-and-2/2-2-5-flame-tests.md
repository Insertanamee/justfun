Flame Tests
-----------

* Metal ions produce a <b>colour</b> if heated strongly in a flame
* Ions from <b>different</b> metals produce <b>different</b> <b>colours</b>
* The flame test is thus used to identify metal ions by the colour of the flame they produce
* Dip the loop of an <b>unreactive</b> metal wire such as nichrome or platinum in concentrated acid, and then hold it in the blue flame of a Bunsen burner until there is no colour change
* This cleans the wire loop and avoids <b>contamination</b>

  + This is an important step as the test will only work if there is just <b>one type</b> of ion present
  + Two or more ions means the colours will mix, making identification erroneous
* Dip the loop into the solid sample and place it in the edge of the <b>blue</b> Bunsen flame
* Avoid letting the wire get so hot that it glows red otherwise this can be confused with a flame colour

#### Explanation for the occurrence of the flame

* In a flame test the heat causes the electron to move to a higher energy level
* The electron is unstable at this energy level so falls back down
* As it drops back down from the higher to a lower energy level, energy is emitted in the form of visible light energy with the wavelength of the observed light

* Why does Mg<sup>2+ </sup>not have an observed colour?

  + The energy emitted during a flame test involving magnesium is outside the visible spectrum
