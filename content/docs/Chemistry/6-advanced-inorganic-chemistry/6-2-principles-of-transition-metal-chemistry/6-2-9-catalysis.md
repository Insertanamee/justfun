Properties of Catalysts
-----------------------

* Transition metals are often used as catalysts in the elemental form or as compounds
* The ability of transition metals to form more than one stable oxidation state means that they can accept and lose electrons easily
* This enables them to catalyse certain redox reactions. They can be readily oxidised and reduced again, or reduced and then oxidised again, as a consequence of having a number of different oxidation states of similar stability
* There are two types of catalyst:

  + A <b>heterogeneous</b> catalyst is in a different physical state (phase) from the reactants

    - The reaction occurs at active sites on the surface of the catalyst
    - An example is the use of iron, Fe, in the Haber process for making ammonia

<b>N</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> (g) + 3H</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> (g) ⇌ 2NH</b><sub><b>3</b></sub><b> (g)</b>

* A<b> homogeneous</b> catalyst is in the same physical state (phase) as the reactants
