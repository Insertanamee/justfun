Arrhenius & Activation Energy
-----------------------------

* The rate equation shows how each of the reactants in a reaction affects the rate of the reaction and it includes the rate constant, <i>k</i>
* However, <i>k</i> only remains constant if the concentration of the reactants is the only factor which is changed

  + If the temperature is changed or a catalyst is used or changed, then the rate constant, <i>k</i>, changes
* At higher temperatures, a greater proportion of molecules have energy greater than than the activation energy
* Since the <b>rate constant </b>and <b>rate of reaction </b>are <b>directly proportional </b>to the fraction of molecules with energy equal or greater than the activation energy, then at higher temperatures:

  + The <b>rate of reaction</b> increases
  + The <b>rate constant</b> increases

* The relationship between the rate constant, the temperature and also the activation energy is given by the Arrhenius equation:

![Arrhenius Equation, downloadable AS & A Level Chemistry revision notes](5.2.4-Arrhenius-Equation_2.png)

* <i>E</i><sub><i>a</i></sub> and <i>A</i> are constants that are characteristic of a specific reaction

  + <i>A</i> does vary slightly with temperature but it can still be considered a constant
  + <i>R</i> is a fundamental physical constant for all reactions
  + <i>k</i> and <i>T </i>are the only variables in the Arrhenius equation
* The Arrhenius equation is used to describe reactions that involve gases, reactions occurring in solution or reactions that occur on the surface of a catalyst

#### Finding the Activation Energy

* Very often, the Arrhenius equation is used to calculate the activation energy of a reaction
* A question will either give sufficient information for the Arrhenius equation to be used or a graph can be plotted and the calculation done from the plot

#### Using the Arrhenius Equation

* The Arrhenius equation is easier to use if you take natural logarithms of each side of the equation, which results in the following equation:

![ln of Arrhenius Equation, downloadable AS & A Level Chemistry revision notes](5.2.4-ln-of-Arrhenius-Equation_2.png)

* The Arrhenius Equation can be used to show the effect that a change in temperature has on the rate constant, <i>k</i>, and thus on the overall rate of the reaction

  + An increase in temperature (higher value of <i>T</i>) gives a greater value of ln <i>k</i> and therefore a higher value of <i>k</i>
  + Since the rate of the reaction depends on the rate constant, <i>k</i>, an increase in <i>k</i> also means an increased rate of reaction
* The equation can also be used to show the effect of increasing the activation energy on the value of the rate constant, <i>k</i>

  + An increase in the activation energy, E<sub>a</sub>, means that the proportion of molecules which possess at least the activation energy is less
  + This means that the rate of the reaction, and therefore the value of <i>k</i>, will decrease
* The values of <i>k</i> and <i>T</i> for a reaction can be determined experimentally

  + These values of <i>k</i> and <i>T</i> can then be used to calculate the activation energy for a reaction
  + This is the most common type of calculation you will be asked to do on this topic

#### Worked Example

Calculate the activation energy of a reaction which takes place at 400 K, where the rate constant of the reaction is 6.25 x 10<sup>-4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.

<i>A</i> = 4.6 x 10<sup>13</sup> and R = 8.31 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>.

#### Using an Arrhenius plot:

* A graph of ln <i>k</i> against 1/<i>T</i> can be plotted, and then used to calculate <i>E</i><sub><i>a</i></sub>

  + This gives a line which follows the form y = mx + c

<i><b>The graph of ln k against 1/T is a straight line with gradient -E</b></i><sub><i><b>a</b></i></sub><i><b>/R</b></i>

* From the graph, the equation in the form of y = mx + c is as follows:

#### Worked Example

1. Complete the following table
2. Plot a graph of ln <i>k</i> against 1/<i>T</i>
3. Use this to calculate the activation energy, <i>E</i><sub><i>a</i></sub>, and the Arrhenius constant, <i>A</i>, of the reaction.
