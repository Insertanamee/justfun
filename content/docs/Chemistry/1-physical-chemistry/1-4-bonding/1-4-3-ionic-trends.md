Ionic Radius
------------

#### Ionic radius

* The <b>ionic</b> <b>radius</b> of an element is a measure of the size of an ion
* Ionic radii show predictable patterns

  + Ionic radii <b>increase</b> with increasing<b> negative charge</b>
  + Ionic radii <b>decrease </b>with increasing <b>positive charge</b>
* For negative ions

  + They are formed by atoms <b>gaining</b> electrons
  + The outermost electrons are further away from the positively charged nucleus and are therefore held only weakly to the nucleus which <b>increases the ionic radius</b>
  + The greater the negative charge, the larger the ionic radius
* For positive ions

  + Positively charged ions are formed by atoms <b>losing</b> electrons
  + The nuclear charge remains the same but there are now fewer electrons which undergo a greater electrostatic force of attraction to the nucleus which <b>decreases the ionic radius</b>
  + The greater the positive charger, the smaller the ionic radius

<i><b>Trends in the ionic radii across a period and down a group</b></i>

#### Isoelectronic Ions

* These are ions that have the <b>same electronic configuration</b>
* For example the following ions all have the electronic configuration of <b>1s</b><sup><b>2</b></sup><b> 2s</b><sup><b>2</b></sup><b> 2p</b><sup><b>6</b></sup>
* However, they all have different numbers of protons, therefore will have a different ionic radius

  + N<sup>3-</sup> (7 protons)
  + O<sup>2-</sup> (8 protons)
  + F<sup>-</sup> (9 protons)
  + Na<sup>+</sup> (11 protons)
  + Mg<sup>2+</sup> (12 protons)
  + Al<sup>3+</sup> (13 protons)
* As the number of protons in the nucleus of the ion increases, the electrons get pulled in more closely to the nucleus
* The radii of the isoelectronic ions therefore fall across this series of ions

  + N<sup>3-</sup> has an ionic radius of 0.171 nm and Al<sup>3+</sup> has an ionic radius of 0.054 nm
