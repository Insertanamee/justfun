Planning Reaction Schemes
-------------------------

* A large number of organic products are made from a few starting compounds using appropriate reagents and conditions
* Knowing how organic functional groups are related to each other is key to the synthesis of a given molecule
* The main functional groups you need to know are

  + Alkanes
  + Alkenes
  + Haloalkanes
  + Nitriles
  + Amines
  + Alcohols
  + Carbonyls (aldehydes & ketones)
  + Hydroxynitriles
  + Carboxylic acids
  + Esters
  + Acyl chlorides
  + Primary and secondary amides

#### Designing a Reaction Pathway

* The given molecule is usually called the <b>target molecule</b> and chemists try to design a synthesis as efficiently as possible
* Designing a reaction pathway starts by drawing the structures of the<b> target molecule</b> and the <b>starting molecule</b>
* Determine if they have the <b>same number</b> of carbon atoms

  + If you need to lengthen the carbon chain you will need to put on a<b> nitrile group</b> by nucleophilic substitution
* Work out all the compounds that can be made from the starting molecule and all the molecules that can be made into the target molecule

  + Match the groups they have in common and work out the reagents and conditions needed

#### Worked Example

Suggest how the following syntheses could be carried out:

a) Chloroethane to ethanoic acid

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

You could be required to design a synthesis with up to four steps

Part of this process can include identifying appropriate control measures to reduce risk, based on data about hazards
