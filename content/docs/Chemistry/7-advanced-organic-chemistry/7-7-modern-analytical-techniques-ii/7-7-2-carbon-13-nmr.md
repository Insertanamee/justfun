Using Carbon-13 Data
--------------------

* Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used for analysing organic compounds
* Atoms with odd mass numbers usually show signals on NMR

  + For example, isotopes of atoms
  + Many of the carbon atoms on organic molecules are carbon-12
  + A small quantity of organic molecules will contain the isotope carbon-13 atoms
  + These will show signals on a <sup>13</sup>C NMR
* In <sup>13</sup>C NMR, the magnetic field strengths of carbon-13 atoms in organic compounds are measured and recorded on a spectrum
* Just as in <sup>1</sup>H NMR, all samples are measured against a reference compound – Tetramethylsilane (TMS)
* On a <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum, non-equivalent carbon atoms appear as peaks with different chemical shifts

#### Features of a <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum

* <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum displays sharp single signals

  + There are no complicated spitting patterns like <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra
* The height of each signal is <b>not proportional</b> to the number of carbon atoms present in a single molecular environment
* Carbon atoms in different chemical environments will give resonances at different chemical shifts in a <sup>13</sup>C spectrum
* As with <sup>1</sup>H NMR, tetramethylsilane is used as the standard reference point for <sup>13</sup>C at 0 ppm

#### Identifying <sup>13</sup>C molecular environments

* On an organic molecule, the carbon-13 environments can be identified in a similar way to the proton environments in <sup>1</sup>H NMR
* For example propanone

  + There are 2 molecular environments
  + 2 signals will be present on its <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

Counting the number of <sup>13</sup>C resonances should be the first step in analysing a spectrum. For example, it is possible to differentiate the three isomers of dihydroxybenzene quickly be considering the symmetry of the molecules and therefore the number of resonances expected in their spectra.

#### Worked Example

How many chemical environments and therefore number of peaks / resonances would be in a <sup>13</sup>C  spectra of 1,3-dihydroxybenzene?

<b>Answer:</b>

4 chemical environments and therefore four peaks / resonances on the spectra
