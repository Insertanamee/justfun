Aromatic Amine Formation
------------------------

* <b>Phenylamine </b>is an organic compound consisting of a benzene ring and an <b>amine</b> (NH<sub>2</sub>) functional group

  + Phenylamine is sometimes known as aminobenzene and aniline
* Nitrobenzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>, can be reduced to phenylamine, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>, according to the following two-stage reaction:

<i><b>The two-stage reduction reaction of nitrobenzene to phenylamine</b></i>

<b>Stage 1 - Reduction of nitrobenzene</b>

* Nitrobenzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>, is reacted with tin, Sn, and concentrated hydrochloric acid, HCl

  + Tin and hydrochloric acid act as reducing agents
* The reaction mixture is heated under reflux in a boiling water bath
* The phenylammonium ions, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>, are protonated due to the acidic conditions

<b>Stage 2 - Formation of phenylamine</b>

* The phenylammonium ions, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>, are deprotonated by the addition of excess sodium hydroxide solution, NaOH (aq)
