Reactions of Benzene
--------------------

#### Reaction with oxygen

* Hydrocarbons will burn in air or oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water providing sufficient oxygen is available
* Benzene reacts will also follow this pattern

<b>2C</b><sub><b>6</b></sub><b>H</b><sub><b>6</b></sub><b> (l) + 15O</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> (g) → 12CO</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> (g) + 6H</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b>O (g)</b>

* Given that a large volume of oxygen is required for this reaction, incomplete combustion could occur

  + Therefore unreacted benzene may remain
* This would lead to a smokey yellow flame as there would be insufficient oxygen available

#### Halogenation

* The nature of benzene is different to other unsaturated compounds such as alkenes and halogenation via electrophilic addition is not possible
* Therefore aromatic compounds will react with halogens in the presence of a <b>metal halide carrier</b>

  + iron(III) bromide
  + aluminium chloride
* The reaction of the metal halide carrier acts as catalyst and creates the electrophile, X<sup>+</sup>(where X represents a halogen atom)
* At the end of the reaction it is regenerated

<b>AlCl</b><sub><b>3</b></sub><b> + Cl</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> → AlCl</b><sub><b>4</b></sub><sup><b>-</b></sup><b> + Cl</b><sup><b>+</b></sup>

<b>FeBr</b><sub><b>3</b></sub><b> + Br</b><sub><b>2 </b></sub><b>→ FeBr</b><sub><b>4</b></sub><sup><b>-</b></sup><b> + Br</b><sup><b>+</b></sup>

* The overall equation for halogenation is

<b>C</b><sub><b>6</b></sub><b>H</b><sub><b>6 </b></sub><b>+ X</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> → C</b><sub><b>6</b></sub><b>H</b><sub><b>5</b></sub><b>X + HX</b>

<b>Or with Br</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> in the presence of a AlBr</b><sub><b>3</b></sub>

<b>C</b><sub><b>6</b></sub><b>H</b><sub><b>6 </b></sub><b>+ Br</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> → C</b><sub><b>6</b></sub><b>H</b><sub><b>5</b></sub><b>Br + HBr</b>

<i><b>Bromination of benzene</b></i>

* Remember that one hydrogen atom on the benzene ring has been substituted for one halogen atom, therefore HX will be a product

#### Nitration

* Another example of a substitution reaction is the <b>nitration </b>of arenes
* In these reactions, a nitro (-NO<sub>2</sub>) group replaces a hydrogen atom on the arene
* The benzene is reacted with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) at a temperature between 25 and 60 <sup>o</sup>C

#### Friedel-Crafts Reactions

* Friedel-Crafts reactions are also<b> </b>substitution<b> </b>reactions
* Due to the aromatic stabilisation in arenes, they are often <b>unreactive</b>
* To use arenes as <b>starting materials </b>for the synthesis of other organic compounds, their structure, therefore, needs to be changed to turn them into more reactive compounds
* Friedel-Crafts reactions can be used to substitute a hydrogen atom in the benzene ring for an <b>alkyl group </b>(Friedel-Crafts alkylation) or an <b>acyl group </b>(Friedel-Crafts acylation)
* Like any other electrophilic substitution reaction, the Friedel-Crafts reactions consist of three steps:

  + Generating the electrophile
  + Electrophilic attack on the benzene ring
  + Regenerating aromaticity of the benzene ring
