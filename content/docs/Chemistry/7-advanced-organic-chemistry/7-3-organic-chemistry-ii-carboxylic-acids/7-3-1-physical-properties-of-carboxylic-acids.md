Physical Properties of Carboxylic Acids
---------------------------------------

Carboxylic acids <b>Carboxylic acid</b> is the name given to the family of compounds that contain the <b>carboxyl </b>functional group,<b> -COOH</b> The general formula of a carboxylic acid is <b>C</b><sub><b>n</b></sub><b>H</b><sub><b>2n+1</b></sub><b>COOH </b>which can be shortened to just <b>RCOOH</b> (In some countries, this family is also called alkanoic acid)

* The nomenclature of <b>carboxylic acid</b> follows the pattern<b> alkan + oic acid</b>, e.g. propanoic acid
* There is no need to use numbers in the name as the carboxyl group, COOH, is always on the number 1 carbon atom

#### Physical properties of carboxylic acids

* Carboxylic acids contain two polarised groups

  + <b>C=O</b> and <b>O-H</b>
* This means that the intermolecular forces that carboxylic acids experience are high and they will have relatively high melting points and boiling points
* The presence of the O-H bond means that they can exhibit hydrogen bonding

  + Not only does this contribute to the high melting and boiling points, it also contributes to the solubility in water and other polar solvents of the shorter chained carboxylic acids
* However, solubility falls as the length of the hydrocarbon chain in the carboxylic acid increases
* The hydrocarbon chains are forcing their way between water molecules and so breaking hydrogen bonds between those water molecules

  + Carboxylic acids with more than eight carbon atoms will be solids at room temperature and are very slightly soluble in cold water, but will be more soluble in hot water
