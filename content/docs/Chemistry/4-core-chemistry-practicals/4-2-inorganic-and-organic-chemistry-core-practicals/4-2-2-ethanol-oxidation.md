Core Practical 5: Oxidation of Ethanol
--------------------------------------

#### Oxidation of ethanol

* Primary alcohols can be oxidised to form <b>aldehydes</b> which can undergo further oxidation to form <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b>

  + When ethanol is oxidised, ethanal is produced and when oxidised further ethanoic acid will be formed

#### Synthesis and purification of ethanal and ethanoic acid

* Carefully add 20 cm<sup>3</sup> of acidified potassium dichromate(VI) solution, K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (aq), to a 50 cm<sup>3</sup> pear-shaped flask and cool the flask in an iced water bath
* Set up the reflux apparatus keeping pear shaped flask cool
* Place <b>anti-bumping granules</b> into the pear shaped flask
* Measure out 1 cm<sup>3</sup>Â of ethanol
* Using a pipette, slowly add the ethanol drop wise into the reflux condenser
* When the ethanol has been added remove the ice bath and allow to warm up to room temperature
* Position the flask over an electric heater or in a water bath and heat for 20 minutes

  + Ethanol is flammable, therefore. naked flames should not be used when heating which is why the use of an electric heater or water bath is an important safety precaution
* Purify the product using distillation apparatus
