Homologous Series & Functional Groups
-------------------------------------

#### Homologous series

* A homologous series is a group of organic compounds that have the same functional group, but each successive member differs by CH<sub>2</sub>

<i><b>Ethanol and propanol belong to the same homologous series</b></i>

* Things we can say about a<b> homologous series:</b>

  + Each member has the same <b>functional group</b>
  + Each member has the same <b>general formula</b>
  + Each member has <b>similar</b> chemical properties
  + Each successive member differs by  -CH<sub>2 </sub>–
  + Members have gradually changing physical properties, for example, boiling point, melting point and density
* As a homologous series is ascended, the size of the molecule increases
* This has an effect on the physical properties, such as boiling point and density

#### Functional Groups

* Functional groups determine the physical and chemical properties of molecules
* The table below shows a summary of common functional groups found in compounds
* R is any other atom or group of atoms (except for hydrogen)
