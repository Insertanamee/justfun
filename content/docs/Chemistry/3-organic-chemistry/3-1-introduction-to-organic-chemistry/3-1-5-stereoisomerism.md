E/Z Isomerism
-------------

* <b>Stereoisomers </b>are compounds that have the same atoms connected to each other, however the atoms are differently arranged in space

#### E/Z isomerism

* <b>E/Z isomerism </b>is seen in unsaturated (double bond containing) or ring compounds that have the same molecular formula and order of atoms (the atoms are connected similarly to each other) but different shapes
* <b>E/Z</b> nomenclature is used to distinguish between the isomers

  + Z isomers have groups on the same side of the double bond/carbon ring
  + E isomers have groups on opposite sides of the double bond/carbon ring

* You may see this type of isomerism referred to in other sources as cis/trans isomerism

  + This is a special case of E/Z isomerism
  + A "cis" isomer would essentially be the same as a "Z" isomer and a "trans" isomer would also essentially be the same as an "E" isomer

<i><b>Geometrical isomerism in cyclic compounds</b></i>

* This causes the compounds to have different <b>chemical</b> and <b>physical</b> properties
* For example, they may have different reaction rates for the same reaction (chemical property) or different melting/boiling points (physical property)

#### Limitation of Cis/Trans Naming

* The cis / trans naming system cannot be used with three or four atoms / groups of atoms when they are all different

  + This requires the use of the <i>E</i> / <i>Z</i> naming system

<i><b>1-bromo-2-chloropropene cannot be named using cis / trans </b></i>

#### E / Z isomers

* To discuss <i>E</i> / <i>Z</i> isomers, we will use an alkene of the general formula C<sub>2</sub>R<sub>4</sub>:

<i><b>The general alkene, C</b></i><sub><i><b>2</b></i></sub><i><b>R</b></i><sub><i><b>4</b></i></sub>

* When the groups R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub> and R<sub>4</sub> are all different (i.e. R<sub>1</sub> ≠ R<sub>2</sub> ≠ R<sub>3</sub> ≠ R<sub>4</sub>), we have to use the <i>E</i> / <i>Z</i> naming system

  + This is based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules
* To do this, we look at the <b>atomic number</b> of the first atom attached to the carbon in question

  + The higher the atomic number; the higher the priority
* For example, 1-bromo-1-propen-2-ol has four different atoms or groups of atoms attached to the C=C bond

  + This means that it can have two different displayed formulae:

<i><b>1-bromo-1-propen-2-ol (compounds A and B)</b></i>

<b>Compound A - is it E or Z?</b>

* <b>Step 1: Apply the CIP priority rules</b>

  + Look at R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>3</sub>:

    - Bromine has a higher atomic number than hydrogen so bromine has priority
  + Look at R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>4</sub>:

    - Oxygen has a higher atomic number than carbon so oxygen has priority

* <b>Step 2: Deduce </b><i><b>E</b></i><b> or </b><i><b>Z</b></i>

  + <i>E</i> isomers have the highest priority groups on opposite sides of the C=C bond, i.e. one above and one below

    - The <i>E</i> comes from the German word "entgegen" meaning opposite
  + <i>Z</i> isomers have the highest priority groups on the same side of the C=C bond, i.e. both above or both below

    - The <i>Z</i> comes from the German word "zusammen" meaning together
  + In compound A, the two highest priority groups are on opposite sides (above and below) the C=C bond

    - Therefore, compound A is <i>E</i>-1-bromo-1-propen-2-ol

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

You may come across the term geometric isomerism in older exam papers and textbooks. The term used to refer to cis/trans isomerism, but is no longer in use and would not be required in exams.
